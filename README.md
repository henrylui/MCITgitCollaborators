Git with Collaborators

Find someone from outside of your project team to collaborate with on Github. 
Add them as a collaborator to your repository (see the video on Git with Collaborators for how to do this).

Ask your collaborator to make a change to the repository.
In order to keep abreast of the changes made by your collaborator, 
you will need to pull changes from the repository and sync things up 
by using the pull command: git pull origin master --rebase

You and your collaborator change the same line of code and 
try to push the change to the repository. 
One of you will be fine and one will receive a conflict message.

Work together to resolve the conflict.

Post screenshots to the forum!
